# Algorithm


## Sorting algorithms
- Insertion sort: Stable, in place sorting method. Start with dividing the sample into two subsets: sorted and unsorted.  sorted subset has the first element of the main set. At each iteration, alg. removes one element from the unsorted subest, and find the right its place in the sorted subset, until no element is.
  - Advantages: There is no need to have the whole set of elements. It is a good approach for a dynamic dataset.

- Quick sort ($O(n log\:n)$)
