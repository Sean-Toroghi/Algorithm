# <a name = 'summary'>Heap data structure</a>

The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree. We can have either min-Heap or max-Heap.

Heap property:
- in min-Heap, every parent value is smaller than its childrens' values. The smallest value in min-Heap is its root.
- in max-Heap, every parent's value is larger than its childrens' values.


Operations:
- 


 
Applications
- implement efficient priority queue
- sort in place in $O(n\log n)$ time
- linear extract min (max) in a dynamic environment
