__Algorithm design phase__

1. The design phase: In the design phase, the architecture, logic, and implementation details of the algorithm are envisioned and documented. At this phase both accuracy and performance are objectives, and the outcome of this phase is more than one candidate algorithm.
2. Coding phase converts the designed algorithm into a program.

Design of an algorithms requires to satisfy both functional (exact required specification and expected features) and non-functional (preformance, scalability, usability, and accuracy) requirements.
