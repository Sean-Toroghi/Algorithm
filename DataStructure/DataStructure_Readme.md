<h1>Data structure</h1>

Data structure plays a crucial role in algorithm design and implementing an efficient algorithm. While this field keeps evolving and each day a new, faster, and at the same time more complex algorithm is introduced, they can be divided into a limited number of categories. The new methods are just iterations of the original algorithm, making them faster. In most cases, the new versions employ randomization and other techniques to deliver _expected_ lower time complexity. 

In this repository, I provide a short summary of the main data structures, accompanied with code examples and a few examples of their applications. I update this depository frequently, adding new categories or applications.
